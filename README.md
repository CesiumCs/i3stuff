# stuff i use with i3
note that this stuff is really specific to my own use case and
definitely references to files not in the repo. there isn't much
point to this repo other than reference. i just thought i'd upload
this stuff in hopes its useful to somebody looking for examples of
what other peoples i3 looked like
